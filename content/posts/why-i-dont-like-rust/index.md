## What is Rust?

"A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software." ... wait, I don't want to hear that! For me, rust is just simply C++ plus ownership, thats all.

## How I Started to Use Rust?

It was about 2 years ago, when I was still an OIer, one night I was just surfing on the internet and watching videos about C++. Man I was crazy about C++ at that time, I read the C++ references day and night, remember all the UBs, implementations in STL, diving down into the deepest and darkest part of silicon chip. Just at that night, I found a comment under the video "C++ is trash. Rust is the future.". At first, I didn't care about it. Just one more fearless stupid challenger of C++. However, for the next few months, I kept seeing comments like that. "Rust" doesn't seems to be a programming language, but a religion, a cult. I got a bad first-impression of Rust.
Lately, I got my first MacBook and the power of apple silicon makes it the first choice when traveling out. However, Visual Studio doesn't support Macos and cmake sucks on Macos too. To make it short, I need a alternative low-level, fast language similar to C++. And it was Rust, or to be specific, Cargo + crates.io. You might wanna ask, isn't Cargo is package manager and crates.io a Rust crate registry? Yes, and no. I think these two are actually the ultimate weapon of Rust. While using C++, I think the best way to use a data structure is to implement it by myself.
